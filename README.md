All input is currently by url parameters: **stocks**, **crypto**, and **date**.  Currently stock data only go back 100 days (that markets are open, so typically 4.5 months).  Cryptos could go back much longer, but sometimes there are large gaps in older data, so it's recommended to stay within the 4.5 month range.
